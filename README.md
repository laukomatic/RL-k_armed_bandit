# RL-k_armed_bandit
### This is a readme file for k_armed_bandit
This is a simple project with julia.
I'm currently reading Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto.
It is a great book. This is an exercise from it or better it is modified exercise from it.
I will also try to implement gradient method. But I have to find out how.
If or better When you find an error or possible improvement please contact me or create an issue.
